* [Exploring Lightning Network Routing](https://blog.lightning.engineering/posts/2018/05/30/routing.html)
  >When we last left our hero Carol, she had successfully joined the Lightning Network and started making Lightning transactions. As she’s become familiar with the user experience side of Lightning, she’s also started to become more interested in Lightning from a technical standpoint. She’s even thinking about running a Lightning routing node herself, with the goal of earning enough in routing fees to pay for her monthly BitFlix subscription.

  >In theory, the Lightning Network could potentially perform "seamless" currency conversions, allowing a payer to spend one currency to pay a payee requesting for another currency.

  >However, a significant technical barrier prevents implementation of such feature as of current designs (late 2018) for Lightning.


## Governance
* [Bitcoin Governance – Pierre Rochard – Medium](https://medium.com/@pierre_rochard/bitcoin-governance-37e86299470f)
  >Bitcoin’s governance matters because Bitcoin is the first successful, most liquid, and most widely known crypto-currency. In the words of Michael Goldstein, “Sound money is a foundational pillar of civilization, and Bitcoin restores this powerful tool for social coordination.” If Bitcoin’s governance model is flawed, it could prevent Bitcoin from reaching its full potential. If Bitcoin’s governance is flawed, Bitcoin’s stakeholders should work to fix it.
