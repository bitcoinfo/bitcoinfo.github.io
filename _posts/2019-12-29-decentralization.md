[How to Disincentivize Large Bitcoin Mining Pools](http://hackingdistributed.com/2014/06/18/how-to-disincentivize-large-bitcoin-mining-pools/)

  > 1/ decentralization is a myth. we use "decentralized" without any specificity as to what that *actually* means. let's untangle the idea of decentralization. i developed a basic grid that breaks it down at the protocol, network, and app layer (dated april 2018)

Me: Federation is a bad model. People: You're against decentralization! Fascist! Me: No, I want *more* decentralization, more equal trust distribution. People: " If ideal social power were perfect equality, we'd be ants."

My thoughts have evolved a bit since this, but the big idea is the same. You have decentralization of validation (“node level”), block formation (“protocol level”), and decision-making and update-management (“political”). Your system isn’t decentralized witho...

Teams aiming to ship cryptographic protocols are facing the problem of attracting top talent to work with them. There is an opportunity to bring together top multidisciplinary talent in a way that is in service of multiple protocol projects.

Measuring centralization can be an informative academic exercise, but IMO the only way to know if a network is sufficiently decentralized is to attack it. If it can withstand attacks from nation states, it's sufficiently decentralized.
