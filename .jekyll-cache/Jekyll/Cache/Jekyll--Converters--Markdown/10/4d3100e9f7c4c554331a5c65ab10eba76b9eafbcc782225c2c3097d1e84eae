My thoughts have evolved a bit since this, but the big idea is the same. You have decentralization of validation (â€œnode levelâ€), block formation (â€œprotocol levelâ€), and decision-making and update-management (â€œpoliticalâ€). Your system isnâ€™t decentralized withoâ€¦</p>

Teams aiming to ship cryptographic protocols are facing the problem of attracting top talent to work with them. There is an opportunity to bring together top multidisciplinary talent in a way that is in service of multiple protocol projects.</p>

Measuring centralization can be an informative academic exercise, but IMO the only way to know if a network is sufficiently decentralized is to attack it. If it can withstand attacks from nation states, itâ€™s sufficiently decentralized.</p>
