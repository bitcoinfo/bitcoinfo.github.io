      <article role="main" class="blog-post">
        <p>I’m Infominer, internet research enthusiast. I don’t consider myself a good writer. However, I love to read, and when I do write, I spend a lot of time editing.</p>

<p>I care about reliable sources, love the research, and have an attention for detail.</p>

<p>What follows is how I came to Bitcoin, along with some bitcoin history. I’ll also share some practical tools and guides, in hopes of making it easier for everyone (including myself) to get more hands on experience with Bitcoin.</p>

<h2 id="a-seeker-of-truth">A Seeker of Truth</h2>

<p>Growing up, I spent a lotta time at libraries, before the internet took off, and ever since, I’ve searched for the truth wherever I thought it may be found.</p>

<p>I was also a computer geek, from a young age, read my share of txt files from the local BBS, including a variety of cyberpunk propaganda. I resonated, from a young age, with the idea that <em>information was meant to be free</em>.</p>

<p>I remember using search when the web was young, in the mid-late ’90s. I would debate various topics in the newsgroups. There were a number of search engines, I probably used them all to some extent. It was a little crude back then… but I was persistant, and creative with my search terms.</p>

<p>I’ve always loved figuring out how to accomplish various tasks using a keyboard, mouse, screen, and some ingenuity.</p>

<p>As a young adult, I strived to be free, and disengage from “the system” to the extent I was able. I couldn’t see a way to change the wrongs I saw in the world, so I just attempted to avoid them. Beyond that, however, I was aimless and succumbed to overindulgence; alcohol and tobacco were my staple foods.</p>

<p>Little did I realize, I could have found a lot more freedom by getting serious about tech from a younger age.</p>

<h2 id="when-i-began-to-learn-about-bitcoin">When I began to learn about Bitcoin</h2>

<p>Somewhere between 2013-15, A friend told me their hard-drive was encrypted and there was a Bitcoin ransom for it. While I had been out of tech for a while, it was hard to believe in some attack that I would be powerless to repair. Gone are the days of trivial virus infections. Click the wrong link, run the wrong app.. get yer hardrive encrypted!! yowza!</p>

<p>A year or so later, I heard a story about a guy that was gonna help my buddy buy drugs on the darknet, “with untracable digital currency,” but instead ran off with their funds.</p>

<p>I already knew about the problems with central banks, but i didn’t think too much about tales of a digital currency. Clearly, I had fallen out of the loop.</p>

<p>I really began paying attention around the time I decided to start a new life. I finally gave into the idea that I must earn a living with dirty fiat money.</p>

<p>I love to read, more than anything else, so I decided that I would get into writing. When I first began, my mind was in sore condition from disuse, and the parade of chemicals it was treated to, over the years.</p>

<p>All the same, I looked for opportunities to practice content creation, and earn as a writer. In the summer of 2017, I stumbled upon a social media site that let me earn crypto. That’s when I began learn what Bitcoin is about.</p>

<p>Early on in the 2018 crash, I ditched the shitcoin and went into freelance, hoping to find work learning and creating Bitcoin related content. Like most people starting without any web-work experience, I landed at a bottom of the barrel freelance site, for dirt cheap rates.</p>

<h2 id="systematic-and-iterative">Systematic and Iterative</h2>

<p>I do a lot more research than required for any given assignment. In part, this is a habit from coming into the scene fresh, and having to do so much background reading in order to write (and properly reference) the advance topics I promoted services in.</p>

<p>Even though I grew up while the internet was coming of age, it’s not exactly like I really knew what was going on. So it’s interesting to learn all the history that I experienced in my own fragmented way.</p>

<p>Beyond that, being in such a new and emerging space, I’m still very much in the discovery phase. Like anything, when enough evidence mounts, after enough study, I may feel sufficiently convinced of a matter.</p>

<p>But how can we really know anything at all? Mostly I just gather and share information.</p>

<p>Once I began a serious study of Bitcoin, <a href="https://www.csbtechemporium.com/bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency/">in early 2018</a>, I was drawn to its simplicity, and immediately identified with its cypherpunk roots. I knew that must learn <em>a lot</em> more about Bitcoin, if I wanted to know anything about cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>I’ve also realized that there is a potential for me to earn a living without touching fiat. I’m all in, on that dream.</p>

<p>I decided to try and sort through and categorize the dense sea of information surrounding Bitcoin, to make it easier to navigate. It’s a huge problem, challenging, rewarding, and I’m learning lots of ways to be a valuable participant of the internet.</p>

<h2 id="not-just-bitcoin-history">Not Just Bitcoin History</h2>

<p>I want to understand all what led into Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin is somewhat complicated, I decided to go back and study the history of <a href="https://www.axiomtech.io/blog-feed/pre-digital-cryptography-a-history">classical cryptography</a>, in hopes that it would help me understand modern cryptography.</p>

<p>Throughout recorded history, the art of encryption was a highly secretive practice. The earliest known forms begin with simple substitutions. The alphabet is paired with a corresponding key, which is used to both encode and decrypt the message, by subsituting each letter in a message with the corresponding letter on the key.</p>

<p>Perhaps, the most democratizing technology ever invented is Public Key Cryptography. Public key encryption changed everything, by splitting a key into two parts. One that may be publicly available and visible to all, and the other is kept privately, known only to its owner.</p>

<p><strong>Using your public key, I can encrypt a message that only you can open.</strong></p>

<p>Public key encryption introduces a shift in the global balance of power, so great, it’s no wonder that governments resisted its proliferation.</p>

<p>Over the years, various governments have attempted to, and persist in trying to eliminate the use of encryption they can not break. At the start of the 1990’s legislation was being considered that would make possession of public key encryption illegal.</p>

<p>Phil Zimmerman rose to the challenge released PGP to the world for free, in 1991. This was first time in recorded history that strong encryption was available to the general public. Instantly, it was dispersed across the globe, coming into use by individuals under oppresive regimes, where the ability to communicate privately was a matter of life and death.</p>

<p>The internet had begun to emerge around this time, and soon the world began working towards digital currency and payments. While there were many attempts at both, digital payments were solved by the end of the decade, and the quest for electronic currency retreated from the stage.</p>

<p><strong>I have this habit where I think about everything in relation to Bitcoin.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-quest-for-decentralized-identity">The Quest for Decentralized Identity</h2>

<p>I started working seriously on the topic of Decentralized Identity back in September 2018. After a few gigs writing on the subject, I had gathered enough links to start building an “<a href="https://github.com/infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id">Awesome List</a>” on GitHub.</p>

<p>Like nearly everything in crypto, the pursuit of decentralized identity has roots in a paper <a href="https://archive.is/lxKiU">David Chaum</a>’s wrote in the 1980’s. Chaum describes a system where users would have auto-rotating keys, giving them a unique identifier for party with whom they transact, making our digial engagements both secure and private.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Computerization is robbing individuals of the ability to monitor and control the ways information about them is used. Already, public and private sector organizations acquire extensive personal information and exchange it amongst themselves. Individuals have no way of knowing if this information is inaccurate, outdated, or otherwise inappropriate, and may only find out when they are accused falsely or denied access to services. -<a href="https://www.chaum.com/publications/Security_Wthout_Identification.html"><em>Security without Identification Transactions Systems to Make Big Brother Obsolete</em></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chaum invented mix networks, anonymous digital messaging, digital cash. It’s hardly an exaggeration to say that pioneered the entire field of digital cryptography. He also happens to have described a system for Self Sovereign Identity, decades before the term and underlying concepts seem to have independently re-emerged through a collaborative community process.</p>

<p>May 2000, PLANETWORK was the first international summit on Global Ecology and Information Technology. Held annually, in San Francisco, through 2004, this series of events, and the collective that formed around them embarked upon the first stirrings of the modern movement towards Sovereign Identity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>beginning a conversation about creating a distributed online social network to empower individuals and civil society, and publishing the <a href="http://asn.planetwork.net">ASN Whitepaper</a> in 2003. (h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/identitywoman">@identitywoman</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From 2004-2005, Architect of Identity, Microsoft Corporation, Kim Cameron, wrote <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?paged=4&amp;m=2004">The Laws of Identity</a>, in collaboration with a network of blogs who worked out these topics, together.</p>

<p>From those early days, a number of organizations, enterprise, and communities have grown around the idea of creating systems for people to identify themselves online, for maximal security assurance, requiring the least amount of disclosure possible for each engagement.</p>

<p>Having control over our digital identity has begun to emerge a fundamental human right. Moreover, decentralization, and placing the user in control over our personal data, would eliminate data-silos of personal information that make iresisable targets for attackers.</p>

<h2 id="enter-bitcoin-and-microsoft">Enter Bitcoin… and Microsoft?</h2>

<p>Thanks to Daniel Buchner, Microsoft is helping to build a toolkit for using the Bitcoin blockchain in conjunction with the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">W3C DID specification</a>, that will leverage the Bitcoin blockchain for securing our digital identity. Those identifiers are to be as widely useful and as interoperable as possible with every other platform in the world. That’s the goal, anyways. Heavy stuff.</p>

<p>So, I finally gathered together enough history, domain knowledge, that it’s getting easier for me to understand Bitcoin, and it’s complex web of relationships and codebases. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is gaining dominance, every day and I’m compelled to focus <em>a lot</em> more on Bitcoin, sooner than later.</p>

<p>So it was awesome when Vlad Costea asked me about writing a chapter for this book, and it was a perfect excuse to slot some weeks in my schedule for Bitcoin, only.</p>

<h2 id="bitcoin-tools-apps-libraries-howtos">Bitcoin: Tools, Apps, Libraries, HowTos</h2>

<p>When deciding which content would be most useful for the community, realized it would be great to have a serious collection of practical tools and guides for using Bitcoin. While there are already a number of excellent lists, resources pages, and other collections, I haven’t noticed any that focused specifically on <em>using</em> Bitcoin and felt this would really provide some actionable value to the community.</p>

<p>I started by sorting through whatever I’d collected over the past year. From there, I began scouring lopp.net, bitcoin.org, Bitcoin Only, LNRoute.. clicking through through those sites, “one link at a time”, sorting them in an iterative process, as clear categories began to emerge.</p>

<p>Then I got into the Awesome lists, and started feeling like I had surveyed a broad swath of the Bitcoin information ecosystem. Next, I dove face first into the <a href="https://github.com/topics/bitcoin">Bitcoin Topic on Github</a>.</p>

<p>As far as finding practical applcations interacting with Bitcoin in some way, it’s hard to find a more comprehensive source than that. I’m still not through the entire list.</p>

<p>I won’t be able to list all of the practical Bitcoin links I’ve found here, but this should be a good start. I’ll leave notes regarding any software I’ve used.</p>

<h2 id="you-must-do-your-own-research">You MUST Do Your Own Research</h2>

<p>This is intended to be a starting point for anyone who is interested in using Bitcoin code \ hardware. These guides and tutorials are a great jumping off point, from which you can explore a variety of technologies you may not even have known were available.</p>

<p>Please. Do your own research.</p>

<p>There may be newer materials or advisaries for any of the following projects. Be sure to check for recent information and be sure that the resource is up to date and in proper order.</p>
